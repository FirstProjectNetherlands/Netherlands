This is our first project as students of Wild Code School. We have designed and developed a website that can be useful for visitors to the Netherlands. The website has some basic but comprehensive information on places to visit and activities for visitors during their stay. This website is created completely for educational purposes and we do not intend to derive any commercial benefits from it. Content and images have been picked up from various online resources only for the sole purpose of learning to code and building a website.
